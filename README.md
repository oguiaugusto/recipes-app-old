# Welcome to my Recipes App repository!

This project was made by [Guilherme Augusto](https://github.com/oguiaugusto), [Samuel Silva](https://github.com/SamuelS00) and [Matheus Benini](https://github.com/MatheusBeniniF) during our studies at [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/).

## Description

The goal was to create a recipes app using React: Hooks and Context API.

In it, we can search, filter, favorite and follow the progress of a recipe. The database is made up of 2 different API's, one for food, and other for drinks.

The application is made for mobile layouts, although it can also be used on larger screens.
